### PURPOSE OF PROJECT
For this study, I investigated the global effects of COVID-19 using the COVID-19 dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. I computed total deaths, total cases compared to population, and many other metrics using SQL. I looked at the effects of vaccination and how it helped reduce cases in the majority of nations.
